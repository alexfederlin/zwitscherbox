Building a Zwitscherbox with a ATTiny

Inspired by https://www.zwitscherbox.com/, I decided to recreate the functionality (you walk by, birds start to make noise) using the following components:

- ATTiny45
- DFPlayer (https://wiki.dfrobot.com/DFPlayer_Mini_SKU_DFR0299)
- PIR Sensor (AM312)

This is the ATTiny code which ties it all together.
